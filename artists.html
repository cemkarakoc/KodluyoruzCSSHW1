      Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an Italian
      polymath of the High Renaissance who was active as a painter, draughtsman,
      engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect. While his fame
      initially rested on his achievements as a painter, he also became known
      for his notebooks, in which he made drawings and notes on a variety of
      subjects, including anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography, painting, and
      paleontology. Leonardo is widely regarded to have been a genius who
      epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal, and his collective works
      comprise a contribution to later generations of artists matched only by
      that of his younger contemporary by 23 years Michelangelo Buonarroti.

    <p>
      Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni (Italian: [mikeˈlandʒelo di
      lodoˈviːko ˌbwɔnarˈrɔːti siˈmoːni]; 6 March 1475 – 18 February 1564),
      known mononymously as Michelangelo (English: /ˌmaɪkəlˈændʒəloʊ, ˌmɪk-/),
      was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, and poet of the High
      Renaissance. Born in the Republic of Florence, his work was inspired by
      models from classical antiquity and had a lasting influence on Western
      art. Michelangelo's creative abilities and mastery in a range of artistic
      arenas define him as an archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival
      and elder contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci. Given the sheer volume of
      surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences, Michelangelo is one
      of the best-documented artists of the 16th century. He was lauded by
      contemporary biographers as the most accomplished artist of his era.

    <p>
      Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi (c. 1445 – May 17, 1510), better
      known as Sandro Botticelli (/ˌbɒtɪˈtʃɛli/ BOT-ih-CHEL-ee, Italian:
      [ˈsandro bottiˈtʃɛlli]) or simply Botticelli, was an Italian painter of
      the Early Renaissance. Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until
      the late 19th century, when he was rediscovered by the Pre-Raphaelites who
      stimulated a reappraisal of his work. Since then, his paintings have been
      seen to represent the linear grace of late Italian Gothic and some Early
      Renaissance painting, even though they date from the latter half of the
      Italian Renaissance period.

    <p>
      Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino[a] (Italian: [raffaˈɛllo ˈsantsjo da urˈbiːno];
      March 28 or April 6, 1483 – April 6, 1520), now generally known in English
      as Raphael (UK: /ˈræfeɪ.əl/ RAF-ay-əl, US: /ˈræfi.əl, ˈreɪfi-, ˌrɑːfaɪˈɛl/
      RAF-ee-əl, RAY-fee-, RAH-fy-EL), was an Italian painter and architect of
      the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of
      composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human
      grandeur. Together with Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, he forms the
      traditional trinity of great masters of that period.
