    <h2>About Renaissance Art</h2>
    <p>
      Renaissance art (1350 â€“ 1620 AD) is the painting, sculpture, and
      decorative arts of the period of European history known as the
      Renaissance, which emerged as a distinct style in Italy in about AD 1400,
      in parallel with developments which occurred in philosophy, literature,
      music, science, and technology. Renaissance art took as its foundation the
      art of Classical antiquity, perceived as the noblest of ancient
      traditions, but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent
      developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary
      scientific knowledge. Along with Renaissance humanist philosophy, it
      spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with
      the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. For art
      historians, Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the
      medieval period to the Early Modern age.
